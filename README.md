## Introduction/Summary
### Purpose

  This study aims to help small-scale clothing enterprises in Lian Public Market improve how they manage their businesses. 
  Many of these store owners still rely on manual methods for tracking sales and inventory, which often lead to errors, delays, 
  and difficulties in keeping up with daily operations. To solve this, the researchers and developer will develop a digital system 
  that will automate sales recording , inventory tracking, and restocking alerts. One local store has been chosen to test the system, 
  with the goal of showing how it can make business operations more efficient, accurate, and easier to manage, especially for small
  business owners who want to grow and make better decisions using clear and updated data.

### Scope 

  This project focuses on building a Sales and Inventory management System (SIMS) specifically for small clothing enterprises in Lian
  public Market. It aims to help store owners track their sales and inventory more easily and accuratelty. The systemincludes a web 
  platform for full inventory and sales management, and mobile app for store staff to handle transactions and update inventory real-time.
  Features like QR code scanning, automatic low-stock alerts, and daily to monthly sales reports are included to make operations smoother 
  and more efficient. One local store will be used for testing to see how well the system works in a real setting.
