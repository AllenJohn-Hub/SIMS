## Introduction/Summary
### Purpose

  This study aims to help small-scale clothing enterprises in Lian Public Market improve how they manage their businesses. 
  Many of these store owners still rely on manual methods for tracking sales and inventory, which often lead to errors, delays, 
  and difficulties in keeping up with daily operations. To solve this, the researchers and developer will develop a digital system 
  that will automate sales recording , inventory tracking, and restocking alerts. One local store has been chosen to test the system, 
  with the goal of showing how it can make business operations more efficient, accurate, and easier to manage, especially for small
  business owners who want to grow and make better decisions using clear and updated data.

### Scope 

  This project focuses on building a Sales and Inventory management System (SIMS) specifically for small clothing enterprises in Lian
  public Market. It aims to help store owners track their sales and inventory more easily and accuratelty. The systemincludes a web 
  platform for full inventory and sales management, and mobile app for store staff to handle transactions and update inventory real-time.
  Features like QR code scanning, automatic low-stock alerts, and daily to monthly sales reports are included to make operations smoother 
  and more efficient. One local store will be used for testing to see how well the system works in a real setting.

## Overall Description
### Discuss system architecture

<img width="872" height="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eaf920c-737e-418c-84c1-8e6661bb7751" />


  The system is designed to help store owners and staff manage sales and inventory through a web-based platform. 
  Admins and staff use a dashboard and sales interface to access the system, which handles tasks like tracking 
  inventory, recording sales, and generating reports.
  All data—such as sales history and inventory records—is stored in a central database. The system also includes 
  a QR scanner to quickly read product info and a QR printer to create labels for new items. A recommender feature 
  suggests products to restock or promote, while a reporting tool helps store owners track business performance.
  Overall, this setup makes daily operations faster, more accurate, and easier to manage.

The system is built using tools that make it efficient, secure, and easy to use. Windows 10 is used as the main 
operating system to ensure a stable development environment. JavaScript is the main programming language, 
supported by Visual Studio Code for writing and debugging code.
For the front end, React.js is used for the web version and React Native for the mobile app, making the system 
accessible on different devices. The back end uses Node.js with Express.js to handle system logic and communication 
with the database. MySQL stores important data like sales records, inventory, and user info.
To make sales and inventory updates faster, the system includes a QR scanner using React Native Vision Camera. 
Security is handled by JWT for user login and encrypted storage to protect sensitive data. All these tools work 
together to support small clothing store owners with a reliable and modern system.

### Add use case characteristics and other diagrams

#### Use Case Diagram

<img width="899" height="898" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02e2e9fe-8352-448c-b7d8-61303e9dd63b" />

The Use Case Diagram gives a clear view of how users interact with the Sales and Inventory Management System. 
It highlights two main users: the Store Owner and the Staff. Each of them has access to specific tasks within the system.
The diagram groups all system functions inside a blue boundary, showing they are part of the system’s main features. 
Tasks like managing inventory, handling sales transactions, and viewing reports are shown as ovals, representing the 
key actions users can perform. Arrows between the users and these tasks indicate what each role can do.
Overall, this diagram helps explain how the system supports day-to-day business activities by showing who does what in a simple, visual way.


#### Requirements Analysis

<img width="747" height="456" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de03c2ae-18d0-4477-aa03-d40f1991285f" />

The system is designed to handle key business operations efficiently and securely. It includes secure user login, inventory management, 
and sales processing. It can generate QR codes for new products, track sales automatically, and provide real-time sales and inventory reports.
To support better decision-making, the system offers restocking suggestions based on sales trends and sends alerts when stock is low. 
All data is regularly synced and backed up, ensuring both security and easy access when needed.


#### Context Diagram

<img width="951" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b2d0b1-5393-4627-a8a6-34bed322e86c" />

The context diagram shows how the Sales and Inventory Management System (SIMS) connects and exchanges data with its two main users: Admin and Staff. 
The Admin manages product information and receives important reports like sales trends, stock lists, and overall sales summaries to help with decision-making. 
The Staff enters product data and checks the stock list to keep track of inventory.
SIMS serves as the central system, handling all data input and output to make sure sales and inventory information stays accurate and up-to-date.


#### Data Flow Diagram

<img width="955" height="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629b250f-e5d3-4994-b4d4-a6061d3da2e1" />

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) shows how data moves through the system and how different parts work together. 
It maps out the key processes involved in managing products, inventory, and sales records.
The diagram also shows where data is stored and how it flows between the system and users like the Admin and Staff. 
It helps explain how information is collected, updated, and used to generate reports—making sure everything is accurate and organized for smooth business operations.



### Constraints, limitation and dependencies

  While the system offers helpful features for sales and inventory management, it also has some limitations. 
  It is designed specifically for clothing retailers, so it may not work well for other business types without changes. 
  The system only supports basic financial reports and does not include advanced accounting, payroll, or supplier management, which store owners must handle separately.
  QR code generation is available, but the system does not allow direct input of QR tag details, and it does not automate 
  BIR ledger or official receipts due to compliance rules. The mobile app is limited to processing transactions and does not support full business management features.
  Since the system depends on internet connectivity for real-time updates, it may not function properly in areas with unstable connections. 
  Despite these limitations, the project is focused on helping RTW store owners in Lian Public Market improve their daily operations. 
  Future updates could include features for broader business needs like supplier tracking, multi-store management, and more detailed financial tools.
